Bugs from unit testing
	isGameOver() 
		doesn't account for accidental negative provinces 
		doesn't account for accidental negative supply counts 
	updateCoins() 
		doesn't check for unknown players 
		doesn't check that hand count is correct 
	smithy() 
		hand count not correct 
Bugs from manual debugging
	cardEffectAdventurer()
		draws 3 treasure cards instead of 2
	cardEffectMine()
		invalid flag, which is taken as flag 0 and will add to discard instead of added to hand

There was nothing too different from the testing done on my own individual code compared to my group members code. Though when manually debugging my group members code, I was able to see where the bugs were introduced based on what the card functions were actually supposed to do.
